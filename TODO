1. Begin creating game engine?
    - Initialize board
    - Print out starting board
    - Inform player of the country they are
    - Ask for starting moves
2. Create function to test validity of orders
    - change is_adjacent
        ~ must test the PATH, not just two provinces
        ~ return true as base case, false if two provinces aren't adjacent?
