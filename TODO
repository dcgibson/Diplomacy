1. Begin creating game engine?
    - Initialize board
    - Print out starting board
    - Inform player of the country they are
    - Ask for starting moves

2. Continue work on init_board
    - Add more provinces
    - Need to have alternative method of storing province initializations,
      away from module.
        ~ Maybe another file?
        ~ can't initialize before type declaration
