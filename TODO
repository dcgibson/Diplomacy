1. Begin creating game engine?
    - Initialize board
    - Print out starting board
    - Inform player of the country they are
    - Ask for starting moves

2. Continue work on init_board
    - Add more provinces
    - Create forces by matching based on name of province for fleets, all else armies?

3. FIX INIT_FORCES
    - Right now pretty sure it's infinitely recursive
    - maybe have helper function to loop through bd.provs?
