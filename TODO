1. Create function to initialize forces
    - trouble with generating names for forces
    - use ctr function to auto generate names
    - use hashtbl to tie strings to forces
2. init_board function
3. Maybe change implementation to mutable dictionary with immutable keys being
   provinces and mutable values being forces
   - Use hashtbl module
